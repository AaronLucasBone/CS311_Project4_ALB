            <p> and by we, I mean me! But hey, by any means necessary I will graduate, and yes, you can consider that a threat. But forreal, this project is obviously not great, that being said, hey man doing my best out here. that's my reflection, doing my best! despite it may look, by the state of these things. also, wow HTML is easy. I learned this in about 2 hours--the majority. It has its issues too of course, but honestly, using one of those style sheets seems like it would make it an easy job, but im sure I don't know everything.
